Project Handover Document: VESPA Video Platform Enhancements
Date: (Please fill in the current date)
I. Project Overview:
The VESPA Video Platform is a Flask-based web application designed to host and categorize educational videos, primarily focusing on the VESPA (Vision, Effort, Systems, Practice, Attitude) framework. Users can browse videos by category, view embedded videos from platforms like Muse.ai, YouTube, and Vimeo, and interact with features like "likes." The platform also includes an admin section for managing video content, categories, and series.
II. Focus of Recent Development Session(s):
The primary goal of the recent development work was to implement a comprehensive search functionality and enhance the user interface for better navigation and a more polished look.
III. Key Features & Changes Implemented:
Database Schema Enhancements for Search:
problems Table Created:
Stores predefined problems videos can address (e.g., "Unclear future goals").
Columns: problem_id (PK), problem_text, theme (e.g., VISION, EFFORT).
Populated from VESPA Problems.txt.
video_problems Table Created:
A join table linking videos to problems (many-to-many).
Columns: id (PK), video_db_id (FK to videos.id), problem_id (FK to problems.problem_id).
keywords Column Added to videos Table:
A TEXT column to store comma-separated keywords for each video to aid search.
Backend (app.py) Modifications:
load_data() Updated:
Now fetches keywords for each video.
Joins with problems and video_problems to retrieve associated problems for each video. Video objects now contain a list of their associated problems (text and theme).
get_all_problems() Function Added:
Fetches all unique problems from the problems table, used for populating search filters/dropdowns.
/search Route Created:
Accepts a query (from text input) or problem_query (from dropdown) GET parameter.
Performs a case-insensitive search across:
Video titles
Video keywords
Associated problem texts
Associated problem themes
Video category names
Renders templates/search_results.html with the filtered results.
Context Variables Updated:
Routes like index, search, and admin routes (admin_dashboard, admin_login, edit_video, admin_manage_series) now pass all_problems (from get_all_problems()) to their respective templates. This is primarily for the search modal included in base.html.
Admin Video Management (add_video, edit_video functions):
Updated to handle the new keywords field: saving to/retrieving from the videos table.
Updated to handle problem assignments: saving to/retrieving from the video_problems table (deleting old and inserting new assignments on edit).
Frontend (Template) Modifications:
templates/base.html Created:
Provides a consistent site-wide structure (header, navbar, footer, common CSS/JS).
Includes Bootstrap 5.3.3, Bootstrap Icons, and style.css.
Contains the main public-facing navbar with a "Search" button triggering a modal.
Includes _search_modal.html.
templates/index.html Updated:
Now extends base.html.
Redundant HTML (doctype, head, body, common CSS/JS, main navbar, footer) removed.
Page-specific styles moved to {% block head_extra %}.
Page-specific scripts (like button, success modal) moved to {% block scripts_extra %}.
New Header: The main page header was restyled with a theme color (teal background, white text) and improved layout.
Category Navigation Buttons: A new section added below the page explainer with buttons linking to each category section on the page for quick scrolling.
templates/_search_modal.html Created & Integrated:
Contains the search modal with a text input and a dropdown for selecting problems (populated by all_problems).
The text input field was made larger (form-control-lg).
Submits to the /search route.
templates/search_results.html Created & Updated:
Extends base.html.
Displays search results in a card layout.
Video embedding logic updated to correctly display Muse.ai (now using <iframe>), YouTube, and Vimeo videos directly in the cards.
The redundant "Watch Video" button and its associated _video_play_modal.html / JavaScript were removed as videos are now directly playable in the search result cards.
Muse.ai Video Embedding Switched to <iframe>:
All Muse.ai video embeds in index.html and search_results.html were changed from the JS SDK (<div class="muse-video-player">) to the <iframe> method (<iframe src="https://muse.ai/embed/VIDEO_ID?params...">). This resolved issues with player controls not appearing correctly for certain video dimensions.
Admin Templates (admin.html, admin_edit_video.html):
Forms updated to include a textarea for keywords and a multi-select dropdown for assigning problems to videos. These are populated with existing data when editing.
IV. Important Information & Current State:
Database Population:
The problems table is populated with the initial list.
Manual Action Required by User: To make the search effective, existing videos need to be updated:
Populate the keywords column in the videos table.
Create associations in the video_problems table linking videos to relevant problems.
The admin interface now supports adding/editing these keywords and problem associations for new and existing videos.
Muse.ai Video Controls: Switching to <iframe> for Muse.ai embeds has reportedly solved the issue of player controls not displaying correctly for videos of varying dimensions.
Linter Errors: Persistent linter errors exist in index.html (and potentially admin.html) related to Jinja templating within <style> tags. These do not appear to affect functionality and have been deferred.
User Experience Enhancements:
The main page header is visually improved.
Quick navigation buttons for categories are added to index.html.
The search input in the modal is larger.
V. Next Steps for New Context Window (Suggestions):
Thorough Testing of Admin Interface:
Add several new videos using the updated admin form, ensuring keywords and problems are saved correctly.
Edit multiple existing videos, modifying their keywords and problem assignments. Verify changes in the database and via public site search.
Data Population: Dedicate time to go through all existing videos and assign appropriate keywords and problems using the updated admin interface.
Category-Specific Search (Previously Discussed "Nice to Have"):
Consider adding small search inputs within each category section on index.html that would filter search results to that specific category.
This would involve frontend changes to index.html and backend updates to the /search route to handle a category_key parameter.
Further UI/UX Refinements:
Consider styling for the category navigation buttons (e.g., using category colors, though this needs careful consideration for visual consistency and accessibility).
Any other feedback from user testing.
Address Linter Errors: If desired, investigate the linter errors in templates further, though they seem to be non-critical.
Code Cleanup/Refactoring: Review app.py and templates for any potential minor refactorings or comment additions now that major features are in place.
