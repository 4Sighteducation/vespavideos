Project Update & Handover: Video Page Enhancements (Session Summary)
Date: (Please fill in the current date)
Focus of this Session: Implementing the "Fresh New Vids" category, refining category display order and icons, and resolving UI issues with the marketing video.
I. Key Changes & Features Implemented:
"Fresh New Vids" Category (Request 2):
Backend (app.py):
Modified load_data() to fetch created_at for all videos.
Dynamically creates a "Fresh New Vids" category.
Populates this category with videos created in the last 14 days, sorted with the newest first.
Assigns the theme color #00e5db and the bi-stars icon to this category.
Frontend (templates/index.html):
The "Fresh New Vids" section is now explicitly rendered immediately after the "Welcome to VESPA Videos!" page explainer section and before the "Transform Student Success" marketing banner.
The main category rendering loop correctly skips "Fresh New Vids" to prevent duplication.
Category Display Enhancements:
Top 3 Liked Videos per Category (Request 1):
app.py (load_data()): Videos within each existing VESPA category are now sorted by 'likes' (descending), then by 'title' (ascending) as a secondary sort. templates/index.html was already showing the top 3.
Category Icons:
app.py (load_data()): Logic added to associate a specific Bootstrap icon (e.g., bi-lightbulb for Vision, bi-graph-up for Effort) with each category, including "Fresh New Vids" (bi-stars), "Community Favourites" (bi-heart-fill), and "Featured Series" (bi-star-fill). Icon lookup is case-insensitive for database category keys.
templates/index.html: All category titles (in main page sections and modals) now display their assigned icon.
Marketing Video UI Resolution:
Relocation & Restructure (templates/index.html):
The marketing promo video has been moved into the "Transform Student Success with VESPA Academy" section.
This section now uses a Bootstrap row with two columns: text content (logo, heading, paragraph) on the left (col-lg-7) and the video on the right (col-lg-5). This provides responsive layout.
Previous inline CSS for max-width and background-color on the video container was removed, with sizing now handled by the column and general CSS.
Descriptive text "Watch our recent entry for the BESA Evidence & Impact Award." was added below the marketing video.
The marketing video's own <h4> title is now visually hidden to avoid redundancy with the section title.
Database Prerequisite:
The videos table was updated (by you, based on guidance) to include a created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP column, which is essential for the "Fresh New Vids" functionality.
General Template & Backend Adjustments:
app.py (index() route): Modified to pass an ordered list of category tuples (key, data) to the template, facilitating the desired display order.
templates/index.html:
Jinja loops iterating over categories were updated to correctly handle the list-of-tuples structure.
Ensured id attributes for "like count" spans are unique across different page sections and modals (e.g., like-count-{{cat_key}}-{{video.db_id}}).
II. Files Modified:
app.py
templates/index.html
III. Status of Original Requests:
Request 1 (Top 3 Liked Videos): Completed.
Request 2 ("Fresh New Vids" Category): Completed.
Request 3 (Page Explainer): Completed (prior to this session).
Request 4 (Search Function): Remains outstanding.
IV. Next Steps (for new context window):
